# Company Landing Page

I have designed a responsive website using a free figma template available on the internet. I have used the same layout model (Flexbox) and architecture as before [in Sports Website](https://monikagharat.wordpress.com/2018/12/20/sports-website-desktop-and-mobile-view) but with few necessary improvements.
